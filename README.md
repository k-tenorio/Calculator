# Calculator

A beginner friendly calculator built in Java using swing GUI. 
This project allows user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Note: This calculator can handle only one operation (e.g., '3+5). Complex expressions like '3+5-2' are not supported.

This project was created as a part of my learning journey in java programming. It showcase GUI creation, user input, and basic arithmetic logic.
